# Documentation

## Apps
The apps are the starting point of a RasMoon program, it allows you to organize your program in different tasks and also get multi-tasking or pseudo multi threading thanks to Lua coroutine's.
Learn about the apps:
* [HelloWorld](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/HelloWorld)
* [More about apps](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Apps) 

> You must not use Apps to enjoy all the features of RasMoon. At the moment, it's kind of experimentation.

## Data
### Data structures
RasMoon offers common datastructures:
* [Stack: LIFO (push/pop)](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Stack)
* [Queue: FIFO (push/pop)](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Queue)
* [Priority Queue: custom sort (push/pop)](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/PriorityQueue)

With these data structures you can use:
* [Iterate and IterateCopy](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Iterate)
* [Copy: Duplicate any data object!](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Copy)

### Observers
* [Observers](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Observers)

### Unique identifier
* [UID: fast way to get different!](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/UID)

## Table
RasMoon provides several easing functions for table management. You can easily create or transform tables from/to an other source.

* [Table and Files: (de)serialization](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Table-and-Files)
* [Table and Strings: Split/Join](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Table-and-String)

## Function

* [Memoize : simple way to memoize a function](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Memoize)
* [Curry : simple way for currying a function](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Curry)

## Math

Because sometimes life is hard and you have to deal with numbers and geometry. RasMoon is still there for you:
* [Geometry: sin(-q) = -sin(q) sin(q + p) = -sin(q) sin(p - q) = sin(q)](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Geometry)
* [Arithmetic: 1 + 1 = 2](https://github.com/jdourlens/RasMoon/wiki/Arithmetic)
